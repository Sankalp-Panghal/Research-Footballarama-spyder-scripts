ACCURACY CODE - TO MEASURE ACCURACY

Idea is that we want to measure accuracy of detection
Suppose we have, 10 lines, bounding box information, we store them in dictionary/classwise

for each predicgtion in class, we find which is closest

I want to generate - True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives & False Negatives
